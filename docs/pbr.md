## PBR  
PBR in Teki is mostly based on the [2014 Frostbite paper](https://seblagarde.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/course_notes_moving_frostbite_to_pbr_v32.pdf). Additionally, multi-scattering technique described in 
[this](https://www.jcgt.org/published/0008/01/03/paper.pdf) paper is used.

  * Smith height-correlated visibility function
  * GGX normal distribution function
